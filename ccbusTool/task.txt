1. [done] Use ServiceImpl instead ServiceHttp for react
2. [done] Define serverPackage with service prefix instead web/service for server path
3. [done] Apply point 1 for desktop
4. [done] Implement react ServiceHttp with callback. Callback can be set on init or as compute param.
5. [done] Remove correct prefix for server import path of Service. Ex. used in component
6. [done] Set interface for service callback. Ex. used in component
7. [done] Set type doc for service complete type
7. [] Set type doc for component complete type
8. [done] Allow entity inheritance.  Db tool to generate meta for base class.
9. [] Payload to be typed. Cast type in view components to string and back to original.
      Ex: text field, int to text, text to int
10.[] Java service not prop init
11.[done] Parser fails with {this} prefix in service example {complete()} works with {this.complete()}
12.[done] Allow any payload annotation (fails for class annotation). Ignore annotation type if not known.
13.[done] super should be called in constructor not overloaded constructor
14.[] Make super() call more clever, detach/add when single/multi constructors.
15.[] Make class look up in same package if class not imported, generate import declaration for client.
16.[] Allow typeless lamda expression. Should be deduced from functor interface, but translator do not support it.
17.[] Amend function "apply" to ecma "call" (call takes params seperately but ecma apply as array)
18.[] Convert java Date to ecma Date (at the moment it is timestamp)
19.[] Worker don't take method params
20 [] Parse import like import 'react-tabs/style/react-tabs.css';

        compute(){
            long sessionId=session.sessionId
        }
21.[] Fix - change function callback from apply(par1,par2) to .call(null,par1,par2);
